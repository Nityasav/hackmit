# SchoolTrace

An **Office of the CFO for schools, run by AI agents.** Our project for [HackMIT 2026](https://hackmit.org)
(Maximor track).

## What it does

Schools lose track of money across payroll, purchasing and grants, and only find out at audit time.
SchoolTrace puts a team of five AI agents on the books: they investigate, cite their evidence, re-check each
other, and hand you a decision. You approve, and every affected report updates at once.

- **CFO Agent** plans the work and writes the briefing and the close pack
- **AP & Payments** traces invoices, POs, receipts and payment batches
- **Payroll & Budget** ties out payroll and tests fund allocations
- **Grants & Compliance** tests charges against the award terms
- **Internal Auditor** re-reads the sources and redoes the math, and rejects claims that don't hold up

Two things make it more than a dashboard:

1. **You can see why.** Every action emits a decision record: when, how (the tool calls), why, and what it
   chose against. The Reasoning log makes that browsable across months.
2. **It gets better, safely.** Agents write **playbooks** from repeat cases. A playbook only takes effect if a
   **replay of past months adds zero false positives** and you approve it, and it is retired when the contract
   behind it changes.

The math is not the model's: amounts come from a deterministic engine in integer cents. Agents propose,
humans approve, and payments and payroll are simulated.

## How it works

## Tech stack

- **web/** — Next.js 16 (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind v4, bun
- **api/** — FastAPI, Python 3.12+, uv, SQLite
- **contracts/** — one JSON bundle per workspace, shared by both
- **Model** — Claude Sonnet 5 (`claude-sonnet-5`) behind a provider adapter, plus a labeled replay adapter

## Getting started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nityasav/hackmit.git
cd hackmit

# UI (works offline against contracts/fixtures)
cd web && bun install && bun dev          # http://localhost:3000

# API (optional while the UI runs on fixtures)
cd ../api && uv sync && uv run uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
uv run pytest                              # accounting invariants

# Point the UI at the API
echo 'NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000' > ../web/.env.local
```

## Repo map

| Path | What's in it |
| --- | --- |
| `web/` | The dashboard: 8 tabs plus an MIT / Sandbox workspace switcher |
| `api/` | Accounting engine, agents, workflows, HTTP API |
| `contracts/` | The shared data contract and fixtures |
| `schooltrace/` | The spec: product, accounting rules, agent prompts, evaluation, demo script |

## Honesty rules we hold ourselves to

All institutions and transactions in the sandbox are fictional. The MIT tab shows MIT's **published** audit
reports only, read-only, with page citations; we do not have MIT's ledger and make no claims beyond what those
reports state. Measured numbers come from the evaluator, never from a slide.
